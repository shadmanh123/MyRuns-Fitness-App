Hello,
I got implementation ideas for certain parts of the camera feature of my app from the camera lecture and demo by the professor.
Specifically, the Utilities.kt and MyViewModel,kt was very similar to the one shown in the demo. My implementation for
ViewProfilePhoto and TakePhotoIntent were inspired by the professor's lecture. The setProfilePhoto() function follows similar
behaviour to what we were taught in the demo.
