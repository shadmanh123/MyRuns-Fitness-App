Hello,
I got implementation ideas for certain parts of the main UI tabs from the Fragments and ActionBars lecture and demo by the professor.
Specifically, the MainActivity.kt and StartFragment.kt and HistoryFragment.kt and FragmentAdapter.kt was very similar to the one shown in the demo. My implementation for
ListView in ManualInputActivity.kt was inspired by the professor's lecture.
